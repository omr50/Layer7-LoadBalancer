- handle backend pool sockets closing gracefully and replacing those connections
	- keep alive on the tcp layer (tcp keep alive) helps detect dead sockets
	- Register those connection pool sockets wtih epoll and look for EPOLLHUP (hang up)
	  or EPOLLERR (error) on the socket.
	- if you try read you get 0 bytes (EOF).	
	- normally read blocks, not returns 0. If non-blocking it returns -1 or data
	  but 0 means EOF for both cases.
	- tcp keep alives basically adds "probes" to detect dead peers (sockets don't close after inactivity by default)

- http 1.1 compatibility
	- go backend servers see Connection: close and close the connection
	- you want to keep the connection open. The go servers think your load balancer
	  sockets are the client, when actually they only forwards. So you want to remove
	  but remember that you have the Connection: close header. After getting the response
	  from the server to the load balancer, add the Connection: close header again to the
	  client and then let the client close. (I think maybe add keep alive there as well and
	  handle the close event on the server for the client socket there.)
	- or I think if you send response to client with the connection close header, you can immediately
   	  close your connection after you finish writing (research more on that, not sure how true that is)
	- Also keeping those client sockets open helps the performance a lot because when you use concurrent
	  connections when testing with wrk, you can keep them open and send many connections through the same
	  sockets.
	- client -> lb (remove Connection: close, but remember it) -> server responds to lb -> lb adds close header to response ->
	  sends response back to client -> lb closes its connection on its end after writing (or maybe waits client close and then
	  it closes on EPOLL event for HUP or ERR (look into this more))

- EOF return is on read? And is that because of keep alive, the OS puts EOF there? Or does the OS tell us with the EPOLLERR or EPOLLHUP?
	EOF is returned when the TCP FIN happens and then on the next read to that socket, you get EOF. Also EOF does trigger EPOLLIN which
	is good because we can keep the read event the entire time on epoll, after request is read from the client, still keep the EPOLLIN
	event becasue we will need it in case any EOF happens.

- add bool to the connection to indicate if "Connection: close" Occured. Can be found by doing a search on the vector. Find the start and then 
  slice that many bytes from the vector. Send that new connection to the server, get response, add the connection close to response then send off
  to client, then close the connection. Otherwise if no Connection:close found, then leave the connection open. This will have a massive speed up
  for the server since most concurrent connectors will basically leave the connection open and therefore we will be able to get more out of it.
  Also keep read on the entire time. Don't remove the read epoll.

Steps:
	- 1. find connection: close after getting the entire request by searching the vector
	- 2. cut it from the vector, and set the boolean indicating connection close
	- 3. Don't remove the read event from epoll keep that open in case of EOF
	- 4. send to server, get response (already happens)
	- 5. get back response and then add in the "Connection: close" and then return to client
	- 6. Not sure whether to close on my end after that, or let client send EOF (TCP FIN), makes sense to close cuz of the header though.
	- Q. Will adding the EPOLLOUT | EPOLLET overwrite the read event? Or will it just add. Or should i remove the read, and then add 
	     EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT | EPOLLET? (For now deleting then adding all 3 just to be sure, but no need to do an extra command for no reason.
