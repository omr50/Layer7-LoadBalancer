Things to implement:

- Event driven system using epoll in edge-triggered, non-blocking mode
	- this gives O(1) time notifications

- Leverage All Core
	- one thread per core
	- one listening socket
	- fork or spawn N worker threads/ processes (one per core)

- Each worker has Epoll Loop
	- each core handles a subset of connection
	- fully parallel with no shared data structures

- Connection Pooling and Keep-Alives
	- Keep persistent connections to the backend 
	- This avoids TCP setup/teardown cost on every HTTP Request
	- Might be difficult since the python servers i spawn for testing
	  are not as configurable (can look for different servers or make
          my own, simple Node.js server)
	- Reuse backent sockets via round-robin

- Zero-Copy and Batch I/O
	- splice() / vmsplice() / tee() on linux to shuttle bytes from
	  client socket to backend socket entirely in-kernel

- State-Machine based http parsers like (joyend/http-parser) helps
- Avoid std::string or C++ stream overhead.
- Work on raw byte buffers with pointers



- Questions:
	- Are epoll calls (like wait) thread safe?
		- Don't share the same descriptor
		- Create a descriptor within each 
		  worker and each epoll call will be distinct
	- Or will it give the same task to multiple workers


High level architecture:

WORKERS (One per core)
- Each worker inherits its own listener FD (with SO_REUSEPORT) and
  creates its own epoll instance.
- All I/O (accept, client <-> backend) happens in one edge-triggered
  non blocking epoll loop
- A shared connection pool ands out persistent backend sockets

- SO_REUSEPORT lets each worker bind its own socket on the same port
  with kernel-level load distribution of new connections. SO_REUSEPORT
  allows you to load balance entire connections, not individual packets.
  So it allows each TCP connection to be its own unit, so when you bind N
  sockets (in N threads or processes) with setsockopt(), and then bind and
  listen, the kernel will (on each TCP SYN) pick exactly one of those
  listening sockets to finish the three-way handshake on. Once a connection
  is accepted it becomes a distinct socket owned by that one thread/process
  and all data tfor that client's TCP stream is delivered only to that one 
  socket, no packet level mixing.

- Basically just create a listening socket by doing the following:
	- use socket() to create a stream socket
	- use setsockopt to set the socket to SO_REUSEPORT
	- use fcntl() to set to non blocking
	- use a sockaddr_in struct to define the port and address (any)
	- bind() to bind the socket to the struct
	- listen() to listen on that socket.
	- return socket
	- it is best to create this socket after forking each process
	  so that you avoid subtle shared-fd issues
    
EPOLL under the hood:
- epoll_create1(0):
	- the kernel creates 2 structures:
		- interest list: which fds & events you care about
		- ready list: fds that recently became ready

- epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, *ev)
	- adds fd to interest list with events ev.events (e.g. EPOLLIN |
          EPOLLET)

- epoll_wait(epfd, events, max_events, timeout)
	- atomically pulls up to max_events from the ready list into
          your events[] buffer.
	- O(1), no scanning, just reading a ready queue

- Questions
	- what to use for http parsing and telling when the http request is finished 
          so you don't have to keep reading?
	- If using an externally created parser do you have to call the parser on the incomplete
	  data to tell if it is not valid http request. Therefore multiple inefficient calls?

	ANSWER: using an event-driven incremental parser like joyent/http-parser or llhttp 
	you can allocate a parser instance per connection and each time you read bytes from recv()
	call http_parser_execute(&parser,...) the parser keeps the internal state across all calls and then
  	you can basically know when it finishes. You can feed the parser new chunks each time you receive
	data, you don't necessarily need to feed it the entire thing every time.


	- How do you maintain long lived connections (connection pooling) with the servers in the
	  backend. Does that require you to have control over those servers, or can you do this on
          any http server? The ones spawned using python3 -m http.server, can you use connection pooling
          for those.

	ANSWER: 
   	- How does the connection pooling work. How does the server know when the end of a request is and then
	  it will handle that without closing the connection if you didn't explicitly create that server? Or can
   	  connection pooling be something entirely configured by the client? (in this case being the load balancer)
